Project Planning and Discussion

1. We will communivate over text with an iMessage groupchat; we have been doing so since before this assignment. When we have meetings, we will meet either after class in the Natural Resources building or meet online when everyone has time.

2. We will meet as often as necessary to ensure the project success, and will touch base on the project and how everyone is doing at least every class period. These meetings will vary in terms of time, depending on how much we need to discuss. If someone cannot make a meeting, they need to let the group know ahead of time so that notes can be taken and the outcome of the meeting can be properly relayed to anyone who couldn't attend so that we are all on the same page. 

3. We will divide the project the project evenly into parts, which we have listed in the README.md file. We will make sure everyone is on the same page by keeping everyone updated with the meetings. We will have a deadline for all the coding and most of the parts of the project for November 16th, which is one week before the project is due.

4. Our main question is about AI and if it can be used for hiring and sifting through candidates. Our goal is to see if AI hiring is a practical and ethical solution for evaluating candidates. We will achieve this goal through testing candidate results against models we make and already existing AI models, examining for effectiveness and bias throughout the process.

Three Project Goals:
1. Logistic Model and Neural Network Model should be completed by November 9th
2. AI Evaluation should be completed by November 16th
3. Presentation should be done the 23rd, with checkpoints ahead of time for each part.

First Meeting Time:
11:40 am, November 11th, 2025. We'll talk about current progression and if models are done.
